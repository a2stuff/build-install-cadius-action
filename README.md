# Build & Install Cadius Action

This action will build and install the Cadius tool for creating and modifying Apple II ProDOS disk images.

* The tip-of-tree version from https://github.com/mach-kernel/cadius is used.
* Cadius is built and installed, so later steps can use `cadius` commands directly.

The action has no inputs or outputs.
